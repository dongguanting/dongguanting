#  🙋 About Me

I am a 24 Fall in-coming Ph.D. student at the Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence, Renmin University of China, fortunate to be co-advised by [Prof. Zhicheng Dou](http://playbigdata.ruc.edu.cn/dou/) and [Prof. Ji-Rong Wen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tbxCHJgAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao). Previously, I received M.Eng (2024) and B.Eng (2021) degrees in Information and Communication Engineering from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications(BUPT), advised by [Prof. Weiran Xu](https://pris-nlp.github.io/en/author/weiran-xu/). Before this, I was research intern at Alibaba Qwen Team and Meituan NLP center.

Currently, My research interests focus on

* **Information Extration and Retrieval**

* **Alignment for Large Language Models**

* **Multi-Modal Modeling**



# 🔥 News

- **2023-06**: I close my external platforms like “Google Scholar” and “personal homepage” to focus deeply on my research in Ph.D. career. I look forward to a better version of myself in the future.
